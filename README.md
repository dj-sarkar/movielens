Predict Movie Rating Project

HarvardX: PH125.9x Capstone Course for the Data Science Professional Certificate


In this project I have developed a machine learning algorithm to create a movie recommendation system. It was created as a part of the first EdX Capstone assignment to use the MovieLens dataset for the purpose.

The repository contains:
